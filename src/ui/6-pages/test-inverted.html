			One of us is a sports nerd – the other one didn’t even know the difference between Champions League and Premier League in the start of the project. A problem? No, on the contrary: this turned out to be a perfect match! <br><br>
			The problem with a lot of sports sites seems to be that it either is built by sports nerds (think news, stats and content everywhere) or by designers (think white space, large images, and flat icons everywhere). <br><br>
			We wanted to mix these both perspectives to find a solution where the actual sports are in focus and where a modern design approach would help the user in browsing and exploring the content. <br><br>
			Simply put: to create a modern-looking sports product – with lots of content but without the clutter.
